1. Given a list of student records in a CSV file, 1st task is to construct a B+tree in a binary file where all the leaf nodes are the student records and non leaf nodes hold the keys and offsets of the records which are present in the leaf nodes. 2nd task is to query the B+Tree which is in the binary file based on the student roll numbers ( range scan of roll numbers and perform group by for the result based on college name )
Structure for leaf Node
struct student(size : 64 Bytes )
{
int type;
int rollno;
char name[28];
char college[28];
};
Structure for Non leaf node(size : 64 Bytes)
struct nonLeaf
{
int type;
int offset[3];
int keys[2];
char extra[40];
};
